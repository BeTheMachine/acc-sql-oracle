SQL> -- ANSWER: Disabling the ability to delete primary key entities that reference active foreign key entities prevents the creation of orphaned records.  Ie, it is not allowed so that referential integrity can be maintained.
SQL> --    Professor Lessing couldn't be deleted because Student Smith relied on Professor Lessing.  Otherwise, Student Smith would become like a ghost on campus, forever wandering aimlessly.  And we just don't want that.
SQL> --    After Student Smith dropped Professor Lessing's class, he could finally retire to Mexico, which he promptly did. Now, one day, after drinking one too many coconut martinis, Professor Lessing passed out under that hot Mexican sun.  And that, kids, is how Professor Lessing got one of the best tans of his life!
